        Dichotomy is a thought-provoking card game designed to stimulate
        conversation and reflection. Each card presents two opposing concepts,
        and players must decide which one they align with most. Whether you're
        debating ocean vs. river, illusion vs. delusion, or art vs. science,
        Dichotomy encourages you to explore the nuances of your beliefs and
        preferences.
